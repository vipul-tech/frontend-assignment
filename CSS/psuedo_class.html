        <p id="para">Cohesion refers to the level of a component which performs a single well-defined task. 
            A single well-defined task is done by a highly cohesive method. 
            The weakly cohesive method will split the task into separate parts. 
            The java.io package is a highly cohesive package because it has I/O related classes and interface. 
            However, the java.util package is a weakly cohesive package because it has unrelated classes and interfaces.</p>
