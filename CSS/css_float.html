        <p>Nalanda (Nālandā, pronounced [naːlən̪d̪aː]) was a renowned Hindu and Buddhist university in
             ancient Magadha (modern-day Bihar), India.[6][7] Considered by historians to be the world's very first 
             residential university,[8] and among the greatest centers of learning in the ancient world, 
            it was located near the city of Rajagriha (now Rajgir) and about 90 kilometres (56 mi) southeast of Pataliputra 
            (now Patna),operating from 427 to 1197 CE.[9][10] Nalanda played a vital role in promoting the

             the "Golden Age of India" by scholars.</p>
